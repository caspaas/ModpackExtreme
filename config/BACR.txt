### Turn this to 1 when you have another mod that changes the way players are rendered.
    This applies to Smart Moving, Mine Little Ponies, More Player Models, and more.
    Turning this to 1 will prevent crashes, but will disable player features.
HasModThatEditsPlayer=0


### Keep the names to the left of the equals as they are or else the mod won't read them.
    The numbers to the right of the equals must be either a 0 or 1 unless stated otherwise.
    0 is off, 1 is on. All settings must be an integer (a whole number like 0 and 1).
    If a setting was input as a float (a number with a decimal like 3.14),
    then that feature will be disabled cos the mod won't read that.
    You can also type 'on' or 'off' for these settings to enable or disable them.

### This can be from 0 to 3 (both inclusive), or 4. 0 is off, 1 is side to side,
    2 is forward and back, and 3 is in a circle. 4 makes all creepers act with a random
    selection of 1, 2, or 3 for that session of gameplay only.
Creeper.RockOut=0


### This is active only when Ghast.EvenTents is 1. This is the length of the
    tentacles (squiggly or not) from 1 to 14 (both inclusive). If set to 15,
    each ghast will have a different lengthed set of tentacles.

### Here's some extra space for any settings that were added that your config doesn't have yet.
